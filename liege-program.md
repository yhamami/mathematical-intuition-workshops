# Abstracts

**Paola Cantù (CNRS, Aix-Marseille Université): _Intuition and Axiomatics: the Case of non-Archimedean Continuity_**

**Nicolas Michel (Bergische Universität Wuppertal): _The Geometrical Gaze: On H.G. Zeuthen’s Holistic Conception of Mathematical Intuition_**

The Danish mathematician Hieronymus Georg Zeuthen (1839-1920) is today mostly remembered for his crucial contributions to algebraic geometry and to the history of mathematics. Lesser known are his forays into the philosophy and psychology of mathematical cognition, and his original defence of a holistic conception of mathematical intuition–views expressed mostly in his twilight years, and in texts written exclusively in Danish.

For Zeuthen, the proper use of intuition–understood as a method for assessing and securing mathematical knowledge–fares advantageously in comparison to the use of symbolic devices, be they computational or logical. What’s more, Zeuthen claimed, intuition plays an essential role in the historical and psychological formation of mathematical objects and theories–knowledge of which algebraic computations or logical derivations only translate, but never outright produce.

This paper aims to articulate the relation between these general claims and Zeuthen’s position at the confluence of various major scientific trends at the turn of the century. One is, of course, the development of enumerative geometry in the second half of the 19th-century–the branch of geometry of which Zeuthen was widely recognized as a leading expert. Others, more surprisingly, include the specific blend of Bergsonian philosophy made popular in Danish academic circles by Harald Høffding, as well as the rise of Gestalt psychology. Lastly, this paper will situate Zeuthen’s conception of mathematical intuition in relation to those, more familiar to us, of Henri Poincaré and L. E. J. Brouwer.

**Jemma Lorenat (Pitzer College): _Anxiety, Deceit, and Intuition about Geometrical Figures around 1900_**

Faced with the potential unreliability of geometrical figures, mathematicians adopted a range of coping strategies. Some avoided figures, others issued general warnings, and some carefully distinguished the distorted from the real in the text around a figure. This latter practice–the emphasis of this talk–characterized the representation of point singularities in algebraic geometry, but could be successfully exported to other areas of geometry (and topology) as demonstrated by the mathematicians training and practicing at Bryn Mawr College at the turn of the twentieth century. By explaining precisely how to read figures, these extra textual tools could be representational, notational, intuitive, and dependable.

**Andrea Ariotto (Sorbonne Université): _The Historicization of Mathematical Intuition in Jean Cavaillès' Thought_**

**Daniel Usma Gomez (Université de Lorraine): _Intuition as Imagination: The Case of Aquinas' Philosophy of Mathematics_**

**Faustine Oliva (Aix-Marseille Université): _From Maps on Paper to Bits in Computers: Which Proof of the Four Color Theorem is the Most Intuitive?_**

Early proofs and attempted proofs of the Four Color Theorem include figures ranging from map drawings (Kempe, 1879) to graphs (Appel and Haken, 1977, Robertson and al. 1997). These figures serve two main purposes. On the one hand visual representations illustrate the ideas underlying the proof and help the mathematician to follow and understand the reasoning. On the other hand visual intuition guides the mathematician in the design of the proof. The Coq’s formalization of the proof of the Four Color Theorem (Gonthier, 2005) doesn’t include figures. The aim of this formalization in a programming language is to make the proof checkable by the proof assistant. All the formalization choices are therefore made to facilitate the work of the computer which is devoid of any ability akin to intuition. It seems that the formalization in the environment of the proof assistant is incompatible with the possibility of taking advantages of the mathematician’s intuition. First we investigate the meanings and the roles of intuition involved in early proofs to determine how it can help the mathematician construct and understand a proof. Then we focus on the formalization and examine whether its sole purpose is the computer checkability, or whether it can also give the mathematician new perspectives on the proof and the statement based on some kind of intuition that needs to be defined.

**Andrew Arana (Université de Lorraine): _Intuition from the Perspectives of Kitaro Nishida and Gaisi Takeuti_**

On many accounts of mathematical knowledge, intuition is a source. Knowledge of the infinite, then, poses a problem, for it seems difficult to intuit the infinite. In this talk I will discuss Gaisi Takeuti's account of mathematical knowledge of the infinite. Takeuti was a mathematical logician whose philosophical context drew on the work of Kitaro Nishida, the founder of the Kyoto School of philosophy. I will discuss Nishida’s conception of intuition, show how Takeuti adopted this conception, and explain how Takeuti could use this conception of intuition to give a more expansive account of intuitive knowledge of the infinite than is standard in the philosophy of mathematics since Hilbert.

**Gerhard Heinzmann (Université de Lorraine): _Intuitive Roots of Mathematical Understanding_**

We show in this talk that intuition in mathematics, if interpreted according to the competence model [Heinzmann 2013]—rather than according to the common perception model—can contribute to a better understanding of mathematical activities as well in the context of justification as in the context of invention.

Thus, intuition can be helpful for a better insight into the difference between stringent and explanatory proofs, it can give hints for overcoming the still discussed taxinomy of eliminatory and non-eliminatory structuralism (Parsons), it can be used for charkterizing thought experiments and for determining the aesthetic component in mathematics.
