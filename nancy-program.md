# Abstracts

**Marie Amalric (Harvard & Trento): _Neural bases of math conceptual development_**

Mathematical concepts we are taught at school are recent cultural inventions. Understanding which brain structures allow for their encoding throughout education is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms by which they developed. My talk proposes to start addressing this question, by focusing on the comparison between adults and children’s brains in their processing of advanced math concepts. I will start by showing that adults systematically process advanced math curricular knowledge within a distinct set of brain areas composed of bilateral IPS and pITG. In the second part of my talk, I will draw upon neuroimaging data from children to show that this math-responsive network is already, albeit partially and still immaturely, engaged at the beginning of the developmental trajectory of math concepts. In a more speculative way, I will finally suggest a possible developmental mechanism for math concepts.

**Gabriele Baratelli (Universität zu Köln): _Intuition, formalization and history in mathematics–A phenomenological
perspective_**

According to a certain conception spread by the Neopositivists, absolute
certainty in mathematics is reached only once the deceptive influence of
intuition has been excluded from deduction. Because formalization is the
method to achieve this goal, it gains a pivotal role both in the theoretical
foundation of the science, and in the understanding of its historical
development. The telos of mathematics is seen on this view as a gradual
process of liberation from intuitive thinking.

In my talk I present a different account of the epistemological foundation of
formal science having its roots in the phenomenological tradition. By comparing
Gottlob Frege’s conception of formal language with those of Edmund Husserl
and Jacob Klein, I show how the apparent neutrality of this medium of
expression hides in truth its transcendental dimension and leads to a the
“mythological” view of formalization. The outcome of the phenomenological
critique is that intuition and formalization are not opposed to each other, nor is
the history of mathematics to be understood retrospectively as a linear
progress. As a consequence, its foundations are not to be searched in a
chimerical absolute certainty, but in the elucidation of its diverse forms of
categorial evidence.

**Viktor Blåsjö (Universiteit Utrecht): _Revisionist history of intuition in mathematics_**

Formal mathematics "proved intuition wrong" in cases such as Torricelli's trumpet and Weierstrass's continuous but nowhere differentiable function, it is often said. I argue that these narratives were crafted long after the fact and are poorly supported by contemporary evidence. History thus counters one of the standard arguments against intuition. History also has ideas for what intuition can do for philosophy once exonerated, as intuition's undeserved bum rap has precluded historically rich philosophical perspectives from being pursued. A case in point is intuition-centric accounts of mathematical beauty, which have often been anathema in the last century amid anti-psychologistic sentiments.

**Vincenzo Di Risi (CNRS/Université Paris Cité): _Lambert and Kant on the intuition of axioms_**

Both Lambert and Kant, beginning in the 1760s, fought Leibniz and Wolff's theory of the analyticity of truth. In particular, both philosophers reject the idea that the axioms of mathematics are analytic, and purely logical, consequences of the definitions of the terms involved. Both claim that the axioms of mathematics are instead grounded in an irreducible intuitive act. Their paths diverge considerably, however, regarding the nature and function of the intuition involved in knowing the axioms. The talk will explore these different eighteenth-century German perspectives on the use of intuition in axiomatic thinking.

**Michael Friedman (Tel Aviv University): _Material mathematical models and intuition at the end of the 19th century_**

The talk will examine the three-dimensional materials models of the 19th century, which were conceived, calculated, and constructed by mathematicians in England, France, and Germany, in order to illustrate mathematical objects and concepts. This very concrete understanding of mathematical models might be thought as opposing to the more formal-symbolic approaches at the turn of the 19th / 20th century. However, taking a closer look, rather than being opposing to each other, these two mathematical cultures had in fact a more symbiotic relationship. Looking at, among others, Felix Klein and Alexander Brill, who were among the driving forces of construction and acquisition of models during the last quarter of the 19th century, I claim that such models served not only as a means for visualization but also as what can prompt the emergence of new knowledge. However, in the course of these decades, the role intuition played also changed–and with such models I aim to show how intuition as “Anschauung” became closer at that period with palpable visuality, or, in other words, with “Anschaulichkeit”.

**Emmanuel Sander (Université de Genève): _The analogical roots of mathematical intuition_**

My talk will be oriented in two directions. The first one will show the analogical anchoring of mathematical notions in everyday concepts and will highlight the consequences of this anchoring for learning. The second will present the mechanism of semantic recoding, this time based on counter-intuitive analogies, which aims at overcoming certain limits of the first intuitions and at favoring the development of new ones, mathematically more fruitful.

**David Waszek (ENS Paris): _Demarcating a role for non-psychological investigations of the ‘pragmatic’ effects of mathematical representations_**

In recent decades, the study of mathematical representations has burgeoned, with studies pulling in many different directions—psychological, logical, historical, etc. After a quick overview of (the way I see) the state of the field, I would like to focus on one kind of investigation that deserves further development: the investigation of the ‘pragmatic’ effects of representations on task difficulty and their link to various intellectual virtues of presentations of proofs, theories, etc. Based on two or three case studies from previous work, I would like to explore 1) how to demarcate psychological from non-psychological investigations, 2) what non-psychological investigations of the pragmatic effects of representations look like, and 3) what we can expect from them philosophically.
